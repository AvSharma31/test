    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to design and organize code in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. OOP is based on the concept of \"objects,\" which are instances of classes representing entities with characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods). The main goals of OOP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. This helps in hiding the internal details of how an object works, exposing only what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Allowing a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. Polymorphism enables flexibility by allowing the same method or operation to behave differently based on the context of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors. Abstraction hides the unnecessary details, focusing on what is relevant for the problem at hand."
